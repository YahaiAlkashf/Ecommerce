# Ecommerce
The project is a very large e-commerce store that I built on my own using Laravel for the back end and React for the front end. I learned a lot during its development, gaining more experience and proficiency. I applied concepts like RESTful APIs in Laravel, CRUD operations, and many other features. I hope you like it!
